## Frontend to book store api with JWT token logins

Known bugs:
- still "signed in" when token is invalid. (solution: filter? unsure.)
- Site does not scale at all.

What to do:
- Modals
- Views or components? More views...
- Code is not DRY (HomeView child components) to repeating..
- Add timeout to api calls in search
- Add some kind of filter to Login/Register view when already signed in.
